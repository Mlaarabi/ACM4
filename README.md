# ACM4
 Desktop application to solve the minimum tree problem in a connected, weighted and non-directed graph using python language .

I showed the flow of algorithms which extract the minimum tree of a graph (with or without animation), using three python libraries:

1) Matplotlib
2) NetworkX
3) PySimpleGUI
